# Machine learning

**Machine learning is a powerful method for handling complicated image classification issues, such as determining whether an image depicts a cat, dog, or horse. The primary benefit of employing machine learning is that it can learn from vast volumes of labelled data to uncover patterns and characteristics that differentiate between various classes. This reduces the need for manual rule-based programming and increases system flexibility and adaptability. The model's accuracy in identifying fresh photos may be constantly improved with the addition of new data, guaranteeing that it can keep up with changing real-world situations. As a result, machine learning may be used to create strong and accurate picture categorization systems.**

# Applications 

 - Self-driving cars
 - Robotics
 - Language Processing
 - Vision Processing
 - Forecasting Stock Market Trends
 - Customer Behavior Analysis 
 - Fraud Detection and more
 
# Machine Learning in Action
**Machine learning projects typically involve several key steps :**
 - **Import the Data**
 - **Clean the Data**
 - **Split the Data into Training/Test Sets**
 - **Create a Model**
 - **Train the Model**
 - **Make Predictions**
 - **Evaluate and Improve**

# Getting Started with Machine Learning : Music Genre Prediction
These codes can be used as a reference to build a music genre classifier using the Decision Tree algorithm in scikit-learn library. The codes includes the implementation of the model training, testing and prediction, as well as the storage of the trained model in Jupyter Notebook. This repository can serve as a starting point for those interested in exploring Decision Trees for music genre classification and can be easily modified to fit specific needs and data.

# Requirement :
 - Python 3.x
 - pandas library for data manipulation.
 - scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms.
 - graphviz library for visualizing decision trees.
 - Jupyter Notebook for executing code [Installing Jupyter Notebooks/Anaconda](https://youtu.be/WUeBzT43JyY)
 - scikit-learn's joblib library for storing trained models for future use.
 - A dataset for training the Decision Tree classifier [music.csv](http://bit.ly/music-csv)
